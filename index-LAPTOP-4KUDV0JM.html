                                    Meet Richard Robinson, our user persona, who was created based on the data from the affinity diagram and empathy map.
                                    
                                Richard is a 30 year old financial advisor (workaholic) from Toronto, Ontario,  Canada. He’s currently single and working long hours at the office. He takes his job seriously to the point where his healthy food choices have taken a back seat. 

                                He hopes to improve his knowledge about food, nutrition and cooking techniques. 

                                He wants to find new recipes to impress his friends and family with. 

                                He’d like to maintain a healthy lifestyle despite his busy work schedule. 

                                A bonus would be if he could save money by utilizing the ingrediency in his pantry. He often finds that he doesn’t know what to do with what’s in his cupboards before the items expire and is wasted.  

                            Some of his Pain-points include: 
                            -How-To videos are often far-too-long. 
                            -He’s always missing one or two things that he needs.
                            -Meal preparation is time consuming and he has a busy schedule.</p>

                      <p>Young health-conscious professional workers need to efficiently plan diverse and nutritious meals for themselves because their busy schedules often lead to repetitive and less healthy meal choices which negatively impact their overall well-being.</p>
                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p> We have observed through user research that a busy schedule increases the challenges of healthy meal planning. Users are less likely to watch “how-to videos” or try recipes that require an investment of time.

                        Users need an easy and fast way to put together healthy recipes. How might we develop a recipe app that is convenient and time efficient for users?
                        
                        Success will be measured based on the decreased time it takes to prepare meals.

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 70px;">User Flow</p>
          <p>We then dove into designing the user flow. The initial flow was the onboarding process. We mapped out how we would guide users and recreated the path that the user would take for signing up. Because the app focuses on healthy recipes , we leaned into capturing user food preferences as it was a common pain-point. After the completion of the sign up flow, a separate on-boarding flow was designed for the health aspect. We gave the user the ability to skip the process and go through the flow and enter information on their own terms  and time.   </p>
